## Udacicards

For the UdaciCards project, I built a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Running the project


```
npm install or yarn install
# and
npm start or yarn start
```
